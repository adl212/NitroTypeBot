# NitroTypeBot
Nitrotype Bot that works and types for you so that you don't have to type on [Nitrotype](https://www.nitrotype.com)!
Features:
1. A nitrotype bot to play nitrotype for you!
2. A nitrotype account generator to use to type for you on nitrotype!
Steps to use the bot here:
1. Download a python compiler. I prefer Idle. Download at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Go to cmd and download libraries bs4, pynput, and selenium.
Type this in cmd: "pip install bs4"
Then, "pip install pynput" 
Finally, "pip install selenium" 
Make sure you downloaded these libraries or else your computer will break!
3. Go copy and paste [src code](https://github.com/reallyverytrash/NitroTypeBot/blob/master/src) into compiler.
4. Go to line 83 and 85 to put your usename and password into the places where it says
```#Put your usename here```
and 
```#Put your password here```
do not take away the ' ' in the ().
5. Go to line 150 and change the numbers inside the ```randint()``` to whatever range of wpm you want to race! Do not take out the comma.

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE BOT:
Don't use your computer and just watch the bot race for you. If you try to control the mouse or controller, bot will crash. 
By using this bot, you are taking responsibility on whatever effects on your Nitro Type account will happen by using the bot. 
There is no way I can steal your account and I simply don't want to. 
Does not work on online compilers! Must use python compilers that are downloaded!
